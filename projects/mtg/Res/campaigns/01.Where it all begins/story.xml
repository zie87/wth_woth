<text>In your quests you will have to fight against other wizards.</text>
<text>You will only have your brain and your spells to help you.</text>
<text>The basic Energy to cast your spells in Wagic is called mana.</text>
<text>The most frequent sources of Mana are called "Lands".</text>
<text>For a land to produce mana,</text>
<text>you just have to click on it with the action button (CIRCLE by default)</text>

<text>That was too easy for you!</text>
<reward type="card" value="Forest (10E)">As a reward, I give you a ${CARD}</reward>
<text>Now let's see if you can cast a spell...</text>
<text>Spells have a cost represented by mana symbols on the top right corner</text>
<text>of the card. For example, 2 white mana icons on the top right of the card</text>
<text>means that you have to produce 2 white manas (by activating 2 plains)</text>
<text>in order to put it into play.</text>

<title>Perfect...but there's more to it</title>
<text>You did great, young adventurer!</text>
<text>But you will see that some spells have slighlty different costs.</text>
<text>Sometimes the cost contains a number with no mana color. It means you can</text>
<text>pay with mana of whatever color you want.</text>
<text>for example a card which cost has a number "1" and a green icon</text>
<text>needs you to pay 1 green mana +  a mana of any color if you want to play it.</text>

<title>Great. now let's talk about phases</title>
<text>Once you put them into play, you will want your creatures to attack your opponent.</text>
<text>After all, they are here to help you defeat other sorcerers!</text>
<text>Your creatures can't attack anytime they want, however,</text>
<text>they must wait for the combat phase of your turn.</text>
<text>Your turn is divided into several phases. You can go through the phases by</text>

<text>- Play creatures during the "main phase 1" and the "main phase 2" phases of your turn.</text>
<text>- Attack with your creatures during the "Attackers" phase of your turn.</text>
<text>- Block your opponent's attacking creatures during the "blockers" phase of his turn.</text>
