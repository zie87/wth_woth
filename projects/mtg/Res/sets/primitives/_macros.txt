# Important note:
# Macros are *global*, it doesn't matter where they are defined
# Macro names are case insensitive, and the replacement algorithm does an exact match inside a string
# it means that if you have a macro named MACRO and a macro named MACRO2, you'll run into trouble because MACRO2 will match MACRO
# Because of that, you need to use a unique delimiter at the beginning and the end of a macro, I personally use "__"
