#NAME: Blocking modifiers
#DESC: When using cards like:
#DESC: auto=target(creature[blocking]) 4/4
#DESC: then you can put your creature into
#DESC: "block mode", give it +4/+4, then
#DESC: remove it from combat - and it will
#DESC: still have the +4/+4 modifier.
#DESC: This is tested here with Elven Fortress,
#DESC: which gives a 0/+1 modifier to a
#DESC: blocking Grizzly Bears, which is then
#DESC: removed from blocking. It should go
#DECK: back to 2/2 now and be killed by Shock.
