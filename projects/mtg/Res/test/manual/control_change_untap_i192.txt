#NAME: Control change untap
#DESC: Bug: After taking control of a tapped
#DESC: enemy creature, the creature is displayed
#DESC: as untapped (although the game correctly
#DESC: treats it as tapped otherwise).
#DESC: The script taps an enemy creature and
#DESC: gives you control over it. It's displayed
#DESC: as untapped - but it shoes up as a valid
#DESC: target for Assassinate, so it must actually
#DESC: be tapped. Dont cast Assasinate, instead
#DESC: cast Twitch and untap the creature. The
#DESC: display doesn't change, but Assassinate
#DESC: cannot target it any more. Conclusion: The
#DESC: game state is correct, but the display not.
