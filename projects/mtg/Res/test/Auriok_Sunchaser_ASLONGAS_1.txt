#test originally coded to prove aslongas was broken, it is corrected now. this test now shows that he remains a 3/3 and survives.

#Test to confirm that "aslongas" in combination with ">" works.
#You control 4 arifacts and Auriok Sunchaser. It is 3/3 due to its Metalcraft bonus (+2/+2).
#1 of the 4 artifacts gets destroyed by Shatter. Auriok Sunchaser should stay 3/3 because there are still enough artifacts on your side.
