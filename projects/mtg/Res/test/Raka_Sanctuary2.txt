#Testing Raka Sanctuary.
#Raka Sanctuary's rules text:
#"At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control a white or blue permanent, Raka Sanctuary deals 1 damage to target creature. If you control a white permanent and a blue permanent, Raka Sanctuary deals 3 damage to that creature instead."
#Test 2:You control only a white permanent, so the target (Grizzly Bears,2/2) should only get 1 damage and thus not die.
