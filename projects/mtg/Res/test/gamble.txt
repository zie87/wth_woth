#NAME: Gamble sequence test
#DESC: Gamble lets you *first* search a card
#DESC: from your library, and *then* you have
#DESC: to discard a random card. This means
#DESC: you may end up discarding the card you
#DESC: just searched for. The script tests this
#DESC: by using Gamble from an otherwise empty
#DESC: hand. If the sequence of actions is
#DESC: correct, then you will have to discard
#DESC: the card you just searched for (a
#DESC: Mountain om this case).
