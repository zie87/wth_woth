#NAME: Unstable Mutation removal
#DESC: When Unstable Mutation is removed
#DESC: or destroyed, the -1/-1 counters
#DESC: should stay on the enchanted creature.
#DESC: The script tests this by casting
#DESC: Unstable Mutation on a 1/1 creature,
#DESC: waiting for one upkeep to give the
#DESC: creature a -1/-1 counter, and then
#DESC: removing Unstable Mutation. If the
#DESC: counter remains (as it should), then
#DESC: the creature will be reduced to 0/0
#DESC: and will go to the graveyard.
